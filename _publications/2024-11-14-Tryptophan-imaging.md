## Abstract
**Background**
Tryptophan is an essential amino acid involved in critical cellular processes in vertebrates, serving as a precursor for serotonin and kynurenine, which are key neuromodulators to influence neural and immune functions. Systematic and quantitative measurement of tryptophan is vital to understanding these processes.  
**Results**
Here, we utilized a robust and highly responsive green ratiometric indicator for tryptophan (GRIT) to quantitatively measure tryptophan dynamics in bacteria, mitochondria of mammalian cell cultures, human serum, and intact zebrafish. At the cellular scale, these quantitative analyses uncovered differences in tryptophan dynamics across cell types and organelles. At the whole-organism scale, we revealed that inflammation-induced tryptophan concentration increases in zebrafish brain led to elevated serotonin and kynurenine levels, prolonged sleep duration, suggesting a novel metabolic connection between immune response and behavior. Moreover, GRIT’s application in detecting reduced serum tryptophan levels in patients with inflammation symptoms suggests its potential as a high-throughput diagnostic tool.  
**Conclusions**
In summary, this study introduces GRIT as a powerful method for studying tryptophan metabolism and its broader physiological implications, paving the way for new insights into the metabolic regulation of health and disease across multiple biological scales.
