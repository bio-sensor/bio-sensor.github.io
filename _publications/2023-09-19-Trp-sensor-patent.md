The invention provides a new probe for detecting tryptophan, its preparation method and application. The probe of the present invention contains a fluorescent protein that expresses L-tryptophan and a polypeptide that is sensitive to L-tryptophan. The L-tryptophan-sensitive polypeptide or its functional fragment or L-tryptophan-binding domain is derived from the L-tryptophan-sensitive TrpR protein. The L-tryptophan fluorescent probe provided by the invention can detect L-tryptophan in vitro, subcellular or in situ levels and in vivo; it has good specificity, for L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine There is no response to similar amino acid analogues, so it is a method suitable for specific detection of intracellular L-tryptophan.
