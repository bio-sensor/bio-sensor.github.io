<br>
Hi, I am KuiÔºÅI was born in [Jingjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingjiang) and am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Neuroscience](http://english.cebsit.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), working under the guidance of Dr. [Yu Mu](http://www.mulab.org). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Genetics from the [Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology](http://english.genetics.cas.cn), CAS, where I was mentored by Dr. [Falong Lu](http://lulab.genetics.ac.cn).

My recent research focuses on developing Chimeric Nano Sensors for in vivo imaging. During my doctoral studies, I introduced a novel tryptophan fluorescent protein sensor, enabling absolute quantification of tryptophan dynamics with single-cell resolution and whole-body precision ([Cell Discovery, 2023](/publication/2023-10-31-Tryptophan-sensor)). Leveraging this sensor, we achieved quantitative imaging of tryptophan across diverse samples, including _E. coli_, mammalian cells, zebrafish, and humans, ultimately delineating the systemic redistribution patterns of tryptophan triggered by inflammation ([BMC Biology, 2024](/publication/2024-11-14-Tryptophan-imaging)). <!---Additionally, we applied artificial intelligence algorithms to develop a computationally assisted rapid protein evolution workflow. Using this approach, we successfully engineered >20 metabolites sensors in a short period (currently in preparation), promising exciting advancements in the near future.--->

In response to the rising demands for simultaneous imaging of multiple physiological indicators, I collaborated with [Yulong Li](http://www.yulonglilab.org/)'s group at Peking University to develop a chemogenetic infrared dopamine sensor. This innovation, when paired with a red calcium sensor and a green ATP sensor, enables the simultaneous imaging of distinct physiological indicators during epileptic states in zebrafish ([Science, in press](/publication/2025-03-21-HaloDA)). To further enhance the usability and brightness of chemogenetic imaging, I partnered with [Zhixing Chen](https://zhixingchenlab.mysxl.cn/)'s team at Peking University to develop BD dyes. These multi-colored dyes, with improved brightness and cell permeability, are designed for seamless integration with chemogenetic dyes, enabling high-precision live imaging across various species, including zebrafish ([Nature Methods, in press](/publication/2025-03-21-HaloDA)).

As I look ahead to the next stage of my career, I am actively exploring opportunities for a second round of postdoctoral training. Areas of interest include **_De novo_ Protein Design**, Neuro-Immune Interaction, and Neuro-Tumor Interaction.
