Hi, I am Kui Wang. I was born in [Jingjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingjiang) and am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Neuroscience](http://english.cebsit.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), working with Dr. [Yu Mu](http://www.mulab.org). Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Genetics from the [Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology](http://english.genetics.cas.cn), CAS, where I had the privilege of being mentored by Dr. [Falong Lu](http://lulab.genetics.ac.cn).

My doctoral thesis described a novel tryptophan fluorescent protein sensor, which enables the absolute quantification of tryptophan dynamics with single-cell resolution and whole-body precision([Cell Discovery, 2023](/publication/2023-10-31-Tryptophan-sensor)). By using this sensor, we performed quantitative imaging of tryptophan in various samples, including E. coli, mammalian cells, zebrafish, and humans, summarizing the pattern of systemic redistribution of tryptophan caused by inflammation([BMC Biology, 2024](/publication/2024-11-14-Tryptophan-imaging)). With the advancement of live imaging technologies and the emergence of new probes, the scientific community has raised higher demands for simultaneous imaging of multiple physiological indicators. Collaborating with Peking University, we developed a chemogenetic infrared dopamine sensor, which can be used in conjunction with a red calcium sensor and a green ATP sensor to achieve simultaneous imaging of different physiological indicators during epileptic states in zebrafish([Science, in press](/publication/2025-03-21-HaloDA)). To further enhance the usability of chemogenetic imaging methods, we collaborated with another research team at Peking University to develop BD dyesâ€”multi-colored dyes with higher brightness and improved cell permeabilityâ€”which have been successfully applied to live imaging in zebrafish and other species([Nature Methods, in press](/publication/2025-03-21-HaloDA)).

In the next phase of my career, I plan to seek opportunities for a second round of postdoctoral training. Potential areas of exploration include **de novo protein design**, neuroimmunity, and the interactions between neuro-oncology and the immune system.
